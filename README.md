# Critter

## Summary

Social Media platform hosted by Heroku where users can communicate via CLI in the browser. Users can create an account and post, edit, and delete "Creets" on a public live timeline.

## [Deployed API](https://bjr-critter.herokuapp.com/)

## Problem Domain

We will add an edit function allowing users to edit "creets" so they can correct "creets" they did not think about before "creeting". It is a lightweight version of Twitter and is a great way to connect with others.
